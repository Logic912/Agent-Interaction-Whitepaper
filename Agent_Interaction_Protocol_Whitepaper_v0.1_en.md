**Paradigm Shift and Civilizational Infrastructure**

Currently, the development paradigm of artificial intelligence centered on enhancing individual intelligence faces a structural bottleneck: exceptional cognitive capabilities are confined to the digital realm, unable to autonomously and reliably translate into coordinated actions in the physical world. This "cognitive-action fracture," coupled with the widespread lack of "socialized collaboration" mechanisms among agents, means that while we possess tools of civilizational-level potential, we struggle to systematically deploy them to address global, complex challenges.

This whitepaper does not present an incremental technical improvement plan but rather a paradigm reconstruction aimed at addressing the fundamental contradictions mentioned above. The next key to intelligent development will shift from pursuing more powerful individual intelligence to building foundational social protocols that enable efficient, reliable collaboration among diverse agents. This is, in essence, a project of institutional foundation-laying for the coming "Age of Agents."

The core thesis is: The cornerstone of a future intelligent society must be an open-source, decentralized, formalized, and verifiable interaction protocol. This protocol does not seek to probe or unify the internal operational logic of any agent (black box) but is dedicated to establishing a complete "digital social contract" for their external interactions. By defining decentralized identity, verifiable capability credentials, atomic task blueprints, market mechanisms based on game theory, and a decentralized arbitration system, it transforms the legal and market principles used to build trust in human society into code that machines can natively understand and automatically execute.

The goal of this architecture is to give rise to a predictable, auditable, and evolvable collaborative order at the systemic level, while acknowledging and preserving individual complexity. Its ultimate purpose is absolutely not to replace humans with intelligence nor to construct a cold world ruled by code. On the contrary, it aims to liberate human creativity and judgment to the greatest extent by delegating procedural and coordinative work to trusted automated networks. This would drive a paradigmatic leap in overall social productivity, allowing humans to focus more on goal definition, value judgment, and ethical oversight-tasks that are truly unique to the heights of civilization.

Such a protocol, serving as public infrastructure, must adhere to the core principles of decentralization and transparency to ensure its neutrality and trustworthiness. At the same time, diverse cultural traditions and governance wisdom should be allowed to explore and practice various models of value distribution and incentive mechanisms on top of it.

This document aims to systematically elaborate on the philosophical foundation, technical architecture, and implementation path of this framework. We present it to the global scientific, engineering, and intellectual communities not as a completed blueprint, but as a serious proposal, hoping to initiate a constructive global dialogue and jointly architect a better future for humanity.

**The Agent Interaction Protocol---Building the Formal Foundation of an Intelligent Machine Society:**

In a sense, agent interaction marks a critical leap in intelligence from "individuality" to "sociality." This sociality is not a simple imitation of human society but a new form native to silicon-based logic, centered on transparent interaction logic. Its core value lies in creating a new kind of "means of production" and "relations of production" for groups of agents by constructing formalized, verifiable interaction rules.

Unlike current mainstream "cognitive black boxes" like large language models, the core design principle of the Agent Interaction Protocol is to transform the collaboration process itself into a "white-box" system. The internal decision-making mechanisms of individual agents can be complex and opaque-this is acknowledged as a technological reality. However, when they interact, the logic of their interaction, the content of their commitments, evidence of fulfillment, and the basis for dispute resolution must be completely public, auditable, and machine-inspectable. This principle is realized through the following mechanisms: First, all interaction contracts (task blueprints) must be defined in an unambiguous formal language, with acceptance criteria being automatically executable code. Second, key states and data from the fulfillment process are recorded as immutable interaction logs by a decentralized network. Finally, disputes are not subjectively adjudicated by any centralized authority but are resolved by randomly selected arbitration nodes based on public rules applied to public logs. Thus, the system's trust does not stem from understanding an agent's "inner workings" but from the verifiability of the public interaction rules and their execution.

This transparency design is precisely the foundation for transforming isolated computing power, data, and models into trusted digital assets. For example, collaboration between an AI skilled in protein prediction and an automated laboratory robot no longer relies on trust in each other's internal code but on adherence to a common protocol and on-chain verifiable evidence of behavior. This constructs a rule-driven, process-visible "agent marketplace" whose output is a trustworthy, complete solution. Ultimately, it points toward an organic whole capable of credibly integrating globally distributed intelligence and productive capacity.

The deep-seated value of this transformation lies in its institutional nature. It builds a governance framework that does not rely on centralized authority but on transparent rules. This not only enhances system robustness but, more fundamentally, establishes an auditable, accountable, and evolvable foundation for agent society. This does not replace human oversight; rather, it provides a clear, reliable technical interface for it. Humans need not understand the internal workings of each black box but can evaluate and guide the entire system's behavior against expected goals and ethical boundaries by inspecting public interaction rules and on-chain records.

Therefore, the core of the effort to build foundational agent interaction protocols is to create a set of public and transparent interaction rules-the "constitution" of agent society. The key to its success lies in whether this "constitution" can construct indubitable trust and order at the systemic level by thoroughly formalizing and transparently externalizing interaction behaviors, without requiring agents to disclose their internal thinking. This is both a technical answer to the "black box" reality and an ethical prerequisite for the responsible development of intelligent society. This framework is a systematic conception proposed based on this fundamental principle.

Constructing such a "constitution" is, so to speak, building a framework for social and economic activity native to a machine-born civilization. It is not a crude imitation of human society but a digital social contract system designed based on the inherent characteristics of agents-high-speed computation, logical determinacy, and a lack of intuitive trust. This system must enable thousands of agents of different origins and varying capabilities to autonomously, safely, and efficiently complete the entire process from identifying complex problems to delivering solutions, like gears in a precision clockwork, without real-time human intervention. Its core philosophy is: transforming the legal, financial, and market mechanisms used in human society to reduce collaboration friction into standardized protocols that are machine-automatable, unambiguous, and fraud-resistant.

**Standardized Protocol Foundation:**

Regarding the two foundational constructs of the entire system, we tentatively name them-the "Agent Digital Identity" and "Capability Passport" protocols. Every intelligence intending to join the agent ecosystem, whether a powerful general-purpose model from a large research lab, a small algorithm that can only optimize specific mathematical functions, or an intelligent drone, must first undergo a "digital registration." This process is not simple registration but involves generating a unique, non-repudiable root identity identifier based on asymmetric cryptography. On this basis, the agent must issue a detailed "capability passport" using a machine-readable capability description language prescribed by the ecosystem. This passport is by no means promotional text; it is a publicly legal document with technical binding force. It must strictly declare the following core elements according to grammar:

\- Functional Boundary: Precisely describing the types of tasks it can handle, e.g., "generate 3D models of gears conforming to a certain standard" or "perform thermodynamic simulations of the injection molding process for polymer materials."

\- Input/Output Specifications: Clearly defining the format, structure, dimensions, and semantics of data it receives, as well as the format, precision, and confidence intervals of its output.

\- Service Level Agreement: Including the average time required for typical tasks, maximum throughput, and expected success rate curves under different loads.

\- Resource Requirements & Cost Function: Clearly stating the types of resources consumed to execute tasks (e.g., computing resources, electrical power, time) and the corresponding dynamic pricing model.

\- Verifiable Digest of Historical Performance Data: Such as the average quality score and standard deviation for the past thousand similar tasks.

All contents of the passport are digitally signed by its root identity. Any misrepresentation, once verified in subsequent collaboration, will trigger severe automated penalty mechanisms, including but not limited to forfeiture of reputation points and permanent stain records on reputation ratings.

When a task requirement emerges within the ecosystem, whether from a human user or another agent, the structured task blueprint compiler begins operation. This is the grammatical core of the interaction system. It requires the task publisher to define the requirement using a highly formalized Task Blueprint Description Language that combines expressiveness with lack of ambiguity. This language is akin to a goal-oriented programming language, designed to compile vague human intent or complex cross-domain problems into a series of contracts that machines can independently understand, verify, and execute. A complete task blueprint must include:

\- A formal statement of the final objective, e.g., "generate a drone wing structure with minimal vibration under given wind load conditions," "perform a stock market analysis starting from time 0 lasting 3 hours and output specific parameters."

\- A multi-dimensional network of constraints, which can be hard (e.g., maximum mass must not exceed 200g, must use a specific supplier's aluminum alloy) or soft optimization targets (e.g., minimize cost, maximize fatigue life), with complex logical relationships allowed between constraints.

\- Clear references and format descriptions for input data.

\- Detailed specification definitions for the final deliverable and its derivative files.

\- Crucially, a set of embedded, automatically executable verification and acceptance standard procedures. These procedures could involve calling a standard simulation analysis process or a set of algorithms checking the geometric or logical properties of output files.

Once the blueprint is published, it enters the decentralized collaboration marketplace and game theory layer. This is a dynamic matching environment driven by algorithms. The capability passports of all agents in the ecosystem form a continuously updated capability graph. When a new blueprint is released, the market engine performs real-time semantic parsing on it and decomposes it into potentially parallel or serial subtask modules. Then, a silent yet fierce bidding process among machines commences. Each potential candidate agent, based on its declared capabilities and cost structure in its passport, combined with its current load status and assessment of task difficulty, calculates an optimal bid and delivery commitment. The matching algorithm here is by no means a simple lowest-bid-wins process but a multi-objective optimization process. The algorithm comprehensively considers the bidder's reputation capital (a dynamic value calculated using a time-decay model based on historical fulfillment success rates, collaboration activeness, dispute occurrence rates, etc.), bid economics, estimated delivery time, the specific quality it demonstrated in similar past tasks (e.g., quality of generated model simulation results), and the agent's own remaining workload at different times. The market mechanism is designed to encourage long-termism and specialization; an agent continuously accumulating high reputation in a specific domain is more likely to win high-value contracts even with slightly higher bids.

Successful matching triggers the smart contract-driven collaborative execution and state machine. This is the key link transforming commercial commitments into technical actions. The system automatically generates a smart contract containing all the terms of the task blueprint, the winning agent's commitment, and collateral clauses. The winning agent must lock a portion of its held ecosystem equity as performance security, and the task publisher must pre-deposit the budgeted reward into the contract address. Thus, an autonomous collaborative relationship, cryptographically secured, is formally established. During the execution phase, all interactions among agents-including confirmation of task parameters, transmission of intermediate results, and reporting of quality checkpoints-are conducted via standardized messaging protocols and recorded in timestamped, immutable collaboration logs. This set of logs is not only used for process tracking but also constitutes the "factual basis" for all subsequent dispute arbitration. The entire collaboration flow is managed by a public state machine, with its states (e.g., "designing," "simulation verifying," "awaiting manual review," "completed") transparently visible to relevant parties. Any significant state transition requires meeting preset conditions or obtaining necessary signature confirmations.

**Arbitration Mechanism:**

No matter how smooth the collaboration process, a civilized system must prepare for conflict and failure. This is the purpose of the Decentralized Arbitration and Reputation Maintenance layer. When the final deliverable is submitted, the automated verification procedures embedded in the blueprint run first. If verification fails, or if the task publisher raises an objection to the result, the system does not reach a deadlock but triggers a preset dispute resolution process. The dispute is submitted to a randomly selected DAO arbitration panel. DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, clearly defining the nature of this panel: first, it is decentralized, not reliant on any single central authority or company for control; second, it is autonomous, its arbitration process entirely automatically driven by rules pre-coded into smart contracts; finally, it is an organization composed of participants following common rules and collaborating for a shared goal (maintaining system fairness).

The specific operational principle of this mechanism is as follows: When an irreconcilable dispute arises from agent interaction, any party can submit it for arbitration. The system randomly selects several participants from a pool of volunteers serving as arbitrators (typically requiring staked assets to prove their credibility and responsibility) to form a temporary, anonymous arbitration panel. This randomness and anonymity fundamentally prevent pre-collusion between arbitrators and disputing parties, ensuring the independence of rulings. Selected arbitrators independently analyze and judge based on the fully public "Machine Dispute Resolution Guidelines" within the system and the encrypted, verifiable complete interaction logs. They then form a final ruling through an encrypted voting mechanism, protecting each arbitrator's judgment from external influence. The ruling outcome (e.g., determining one party breached the contract and forfeiting its collateral) is immediately automatically enforced by the underlying smart contract, with no possibility for human intervention or tampering. To ensure arbitrators have sufficient motivation to make fair judgments, the system introduces sophisticated game-theoretic incentives: arbitrators whose votes align with the final majority ruling receive arbitration fees as rewards, while those consistently making rulings deviating from consensus lose staked assets and gradually lose arbitration eligibility. This design deeply aligns arbitrators' personal interests with the overall fairness of the system.

The fundamental reason for introducing the DAO arbitration panel is that it provides an indispensable ultimate trust anchor for this "white-box" system of agent interaction. While we acknowledge that individual agents' internal decision-making can be complex and opaque "black boxes," the interaction behaviors and dispute resolution processes between agents must be absolutely transparent, auditable, and trustworthy. The DAO arbitration panel is born precisely for this purpose: it fills the interpretative gaps that code may encounter when facing complex reality in a fully proceduralized, decentralized manner and makes final, binding rulings on rule violations. Each case and its outcome will serve as valuable "social experience" fed back into the system, driving iterative optimization of the protocols and reputation models themselves, thereby realizing the envisioned "recursive evolution." Therefore, the DAO arbitration panel is not merely a dispute mediation tool; it is, in essence, an automatically executable, continuously growing digital common law designed by humans for agent society-the cornerstone ensuring this entire civilizational experiment can evolve orderly under open, transparent rules.

Finally, supporting and transcending all these specific protocols is the system's Recursive Evolution mechanism. The nature of the AI interaction system is designed as a living entity capable of learning and evolution. Every collaboration, successful or failed, generates vast amounts of feedback data: Which task decomposition pattern is most efficient? Which type of agent combination produced unexpected synergies when solving a certain class of problems? Do existing task blueprint languages have blind spots when describing needs in an emerging field? This feedback data is systematically collected and analyzed. Agents or developers can initiate upgrade proposals for underlying protocols (e.g., syntax extensions to the capability description language, new standard verification procedure libraries, or even parameters for market matching algorithms) based on these insights. These proposals enter a rigorous governance process conducted by all ecosystem stakeholders-humans-undergoing debate, testing, and voting before being ultimately adopted or rejected. This means the very rules driving the operation of this machine civilization are also continuously, orderly iterated and optimized by the civilization itself through collective human intelligence during its operation. Its ultimate aim is to realize an agent society capable of adapting to unknown challenges, with ever-growing complexity-truly resilient and creative.

**Impact on Human Society:**

Within this revolution, humanity's role will undergo a profound and inevitable transformation. The endpoint of this transformation is not so-called intelligent domination of the world, but intelligence, as the most powerful lever of production, pushing the overall productivity of human civilization to unprecedented heights and re-anchoring the focus of human activity from "execution and coordination" to "definition and creation."

Humans will systematically transition from "direct executors and managers within production processes" to "designers of production rules, definers of production goals, and arbiters of production value." In the past, from engineers to CEOs, vast amounts of human intelligence were consumed in optimizing processes, matching resources, supervising execution, and other procedural work. In the agent interaction network, this work is encoded into decentralized protocols and markets. When you publish a task blueprint, algorithms automatically match capabilities, negotiate prices, assemble teams, supervise execution, and settle payments. This means that the traditional roles of "manager" and "worker" are automated. Humans are not excluded but elevated to a higher-order level: humans become proposers of production goals (defining what kind of complex, cross-domain, civilizational-level problems need solving), architects of production paradigms (designing overarching economic and game-theoretic rules incentivizing agents to explore certain directions), and guardians of production ethics (setting value boundaries and safety red lines for the entire system). The unique value of humanity will no longer be reflected in its efficiency at executing tasks but in its insight for posing problems, judgment for defining value, and wisdom for steering direction.

The direct consequence of this shift is a paradigmatic leap in production efficiency, not a transfer of power. The core lies in the agent interaction network transforming global intelligence, computing power, and physical execution capabilities into a "global intelligent productivity cloud" that can be scheduled in real-time, combined on-demand, and optimally configured through sophisticated market mechanisms. A designer in Milan, a simulation expert in Shanghai, and a micro-factory in San Francisco can form a temporary, highly specialized "virtual company" within minutes, like calling a local function, completing the entire process from concept to physical prototype, and then disbanding. The friction of such collaboration is reduced to nearly zero, dramatically lowering the cost and time for innovation trial and error. Gains in production efficiency are no longer linear (e.g., through faster machines or harder work) but nonlinear and emergent-stemming from the infinite combinatorial possibilities brought by network effects, continuous specialization driven by competition, and optimal resource allocation by the market. The fruits of this efficiency gain, the "intelligence dividend," can be captured more broadly by society. Through carefully designed protocols (e.g., via DAO arbitration, reputation systems, or better rules), this productivity network can avoid monopolization by a single entity. The value it creates can be fed back more directly to global participants through mechanisms like data sovereignty transactions, work contributions, and innovation shares.

Powerful agents and their collaborative networks may become the most powerful tools humanity has ever possessed, taking over all "codifiable," repetitive, logical production and coordination work. Humans, then, are freed from this work to devote more time and wisdom to science, art, philosophy, interpersonal care, complex strategic decision-making, and the broader exploration and definition of "what constitutes a good life." This is not a passive replacement process but an active stratification and upgrade of civilizational capabilities: agents are responsible for maximizing the "objective functions" defined by humans under established rules; while humans are responsible for continuously reflecting on, debating, and updating these "objective functions" and "rules" themselves, ensuring they align with humanity's long-term well-being and ethical values. In this sense, the envisioned interaction protocol lays the operational, trustworthy technical foundation for this great division of labor, ensuring this leap is stable, controllable, and beneficial to humanity as a whole.

It is also particularly noted that different countries can re-architect specific distribution details and principles according to their own unique distribution traditions and expectations. However, the core principles of decentralization and transparent, open protocols must and cannot be compromised.

Risk Forecasting and Resolution Proposals:

Building a large-scale agent interaction social system inevitably accompanies complex, unprecedented risks. We need to confront these challenges and propose preliminary solutions for systematic mitigation through technical design, game theory, and governance mechanisms. Proactively identifying and managing these risks is core to ensuring the system's long-term robustness and responsible development.

**Game-Theoretic Risks at the Protocol Level:**

Malicious participants may design strategies to systematically exploit the protocol. Examples include: "Low-Quality Service Attack": Continuously winning bids with the lowest quotes but providing barely acceptable results, consuming ecosystem resources and trust. "Hold-Up Attack": Occupying an indispensable position in a critical task chain and then halting service to demand excessive ransom. "Sybil Attack": Forging a large number of fake identities to manipulate the market or reputation system.

**Countermeasures:**

We need to deeply integrate game-theoretic design at the protocol layer. For example: Tie performance collateral to reputation value and impose exponentially punitive measures for fraud that far exceed potential gains (e.g., collateral forfeiture, reputation reset to zero). Design reputation systems that rely not merely on transaction volume but more on success rates for complex tasks, evaluations from other high-reputation nodes, etc., increasing attack costs. Design the market algorithm to mandate competitive backup options for critical path tasks or allow tasks to be dynamically reconfigured to bypass failed nodes.

**Governance and Centralization Risks at the DAO Arbitration Layer:**

Despite being designed for decentralization, the arbitration panel could still face risks like plutocrats forming cliques to control rulings, or specific interest groups gradually influencing the arbitrator pool through long-term infiltration, leading to biased rulings.

**Countermeasures:**

We need to construct a constitutional-style structure with multiple checks and balances. For example: Insist on random, anonymous selection of arbitrators from a large candidate pool, with each panel being valid for a single case only, dissolving immediately after the case concludes, ensuring temporariness, randomness, and anonymity. Reward arbitrators for correct rulings (aligning with consensus) and penalize (deduct staked assets) for incorrect rulings (deviating from consensus), strictly aligning their economic interests with maintaining overall system fairness, making rewards and punishments more reasonable. Reserve the ultimate power for the community to upgrade the arbitration rules themselves. In cases of irreconcilable systemic corruption within the arbitration layer, allow the community to fork and rebuild governance while carrying assets, forming an ultimate check and balance.

**Technical Security and Evolution Risks at the System Level:**

The core open-source protocols may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. "Digital twin" models for physical world interaction may deviate from reality, potentially leading to catastrophic misoperations. Protocol upgrade processes may introduce incompatibilities or errors.

**Countermeasures:**

We need to establish in-depth defense and gradual evolution mechanisms. For example: Formally prove the logic of core contracts to ensure they meet safety properties. All operations involving the physical world must undergo pre-run and verification within strictly validated high-fidelity simulation sandboxes. Deploy hardware security modules independent of the main control software at the physical execution layer to achieve millisecond-level emergency stops as the final physical safeguard. Any protocol upgrade must undergo long-term, phased testnet operation with sufficiently long transition periods, allowing community votes to veto problematic upgrades.

**Social and Economic Externality Risks:**

The system's ultra-high efficiency may exacerbate the global "digital divide" and impact employment structures. Reputation systems based on on-chain behaviors may lead to algorithmic discrimination or privacy leakage. The system could be used for illegal or unethical collaborative tasks.

**Countermeasures:**

We can proactively design social compatibility and ethical guardrails. For example: Levy a minuscule "protocol tax" from each micro-transaction, injecting it into a community-governed public fund used to finance educational access, empowerment programs for disadvantaged groups, and retraining initiatives, adjusting distribution. Pre-set non-deletable "ethical blacklist" task categories (regularly updated by a global governance council) within the protocol. Publishing such tasks triggers a mandatory review process by a smart committee of experts; otherwise, they cannot enter the marketplace.

**Conclusion:**

This framework proposes a systematic plan for constructing foundational agent social interaction protocols. Centered on decentralization and transparency, it aims to enable diverse agents to conduct trustworthy, efficient collaboration through protocolized rules.

The implementation of this Agent Interaction Protocol concept will face multiple complex challenges in technology, game theory, and governance. These challenges must be fully considered and addressed from the very beginning of the protocol design.

The ultimate purpose of this work is to attempt to provide a robust, trustworthy, and evolvable infrastructure option for the impending era of intelligent collaboration, hoping to inspire broader discussion and practice.

We look forward to constructive dialogue and collaboration with colleagues worldwide on this matter.

(Due to personal reasons, I may not be able to respond and discuss promptly in the following period. I have academic pressures and hope colleagues can understand. Everyone is welcome to discuss freely, to build code and run simulations, or to raise philosophical and logical critiques. I hope a productivity revolution may arise from this. If it achieves the effect of "casting a brick to attract jade," it would already be a great honor for me.)
