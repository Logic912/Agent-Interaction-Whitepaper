# Agent Interaction Protocol Experiment Code

I wrote a Python program to validate the ideas in the "Agent Interaction Protocol White Paper".

Code is here: [business_simulation_V0.1.py](business_simulation_V0.1.py)

How to run:
1. Install Mesa: `pip install mesa`
2. Run: `python business_simulation_V0.1.py`

The program simulates three companies bidding for tasks, showing how agents can collaborate through protocols.

For detailed theory, see this: [Agent Interaction Protocol White Paper](智能体交互协议白皮书_v0.1_zh.md)
